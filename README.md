## Experiment Scenarios:
1. “Graph of changes in failure probabilities for given types of attacks at p(ai) = 1.0”.
2. “Graph of the probability P(p(t)) of detecting a vulnerability when testing with a separate device”.
3. “Graph of the probability P(p(t, k)) of detecting a vulnerability when testing with a separate device”.
4. “Graph of the probability of detecting vulnerabilities in a collaboration strategy in conditions of resistance to testing from t”.
5. “Graph of the probability of detecting vulnerabilities in a collaboration strategy in conditions of resistance to testing from k”.
6. “Generating a 15 x 15 adjacency matrix”.
7. “Generating the minimum coverage adjacency matrix”.
